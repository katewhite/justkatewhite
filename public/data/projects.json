As such, it was important that as little time as possible was taken up with introductions and basic bio information sharing.  With Spigot Labs, the interviewees were able to tap their badge at the station, at which point the interviewee had access to their general work information as well as any other links the attendee provided in their profile.  The other main goal of the dashboard was to serve as a location for interviewers to record notes on each interviewee."

I selected the blue as the primary color in the palette, as it would stand out the most dramatically when used for controls, buttons, navigation items, and any other areas where small pops of color would be required.  All other colors in the palette were used more sparingly throughout the application in order to maintain the simplicity of the apps in the visual design as well.  I selected Open Sans as the typeface to use throughout the application.  The typeface has a professional feel while not being too stiff, serious, or corporate.

This idea would give users a deeper knowledge of the functionality within the apps that they needed to use most often, and left anything they did not need out of the picture for them.  For this group of 5 different applications, we needed clear iconography to distinguish the different apps.  The company branding and logo uses thin, rounded lines, giving it a clean but fun look.  When considering the individual application icons, I wanted to keep this aesthetic consistent throughout each.  Using thin and rounded vectors, I created icons that clearly represented nouns associated with the verbs used for each application name."

However, we wouldn’t know for certain that flows were intuitive until we were able to try them ourselves.  I created prototypes using FluidUI that we could run on our devices for some of the tasks that would either become conventions, or that were particularly complicated.  Being able to tap around the app ourselves made gaps and short comings in the workflows far more obvious than just wireframes.  This allowed us to make tweaks where necessary prior to writing any code."

Removing the thick white borders, softening up all corners, thinning outlines, and adding spacing made for a far more legible and clean look and feel."

Even though there are only a handful of controls on the form, the usability of the form is critical due to the amount of times clinicians interact with it in a given day.  Further, the Aventura product is driven by speed.  The login process needs to be as seamless as possible for clinicians.  As seen in the image of the original splash screen below, the color, sizing, and placement of the “Change Password” button proved to be a challenge for clinicians.  During one particular go-live, almost every nurse we observed clicked the “Change Password” button instead of “Connect”.  In the new screens, I made sure that the “Change Password” button looks like a secondary action by making it appear smaller and less prominent, adding the underline to make it clear that it is clickable."

The more colors we allow the administrators to modify, the more possibility for awful and illegible combinations.  I was able to limit the number of colors that can be chosen to two: the text color and the background color.  In the design, I made use of opacity to establish typographical hierarchy, control states, and button states."
