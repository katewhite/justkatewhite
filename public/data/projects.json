I simplified the main page by presenting only a list of all added conditions and a button to add more.  Clicking to add the condition presents a modal where the user selects the condition and the symptoms.

However, it was impossible to know for certain until we were able to interact with them ourselves.  I created prototypes using FluidUI.  The ability to tap around the app ourselves made gaps and shortcomings in the workflows far more obvious than just wireframes.  This allowed us to make tweaks where necessary prior to writing any code."

Removing the thick white borders, softening up all corners, thinning outlines, and adding spacing made for a far more legible and clean look and feel."

The Aventura product is driven by speed, so the login process needs to be as seamless as possible for clinicians.  As seen in the image of the original splash screen below, the color, sizing, and placement of the \"Change Password\" button proved to be a challenge for users.  During one particular go-live, most nurses we observed clicked \"Change Password\" instead of \"Connect.\"  I made sure that on the improved screen the \"Change Password\" button looks like a secondary action.  I made it appear smaller and less prominent, and added the underline to make it clear that it is clickable."

The more colors we allow to be customized, the higher the possibility for illegible combinations.  I was able to limit the number of colors that can be modified to two - the text color and the background color.  I made use of opacity to establish typographical hierarchy, control and button states."
